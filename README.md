TransBiLSTMNet is a deep learning method developed to effectively and efficiently predict TBM penetration rates for operational management. 
This model features multiple modules, including data processing, a backbone ensemble model composed of two parallel BiLSTM networks, an improved Transformer, a loss function, and evaluation metrics. 
These components are meticulously designed to ensure precise prediction outcomes.
